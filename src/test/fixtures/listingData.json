At the middle of the road, we play commonly known board games which can cater to a casual audience. And yet on the other side, we play fast arcade style video games where one can easily pick up the control scheme. Bonus points for those with a penchant for game development, as some of the games are created in house and there are plans for a kickstarter campaign.\n\nI have been running gaming groups of different types since high school, and I've built up a plethora of niche gaming options.

Bring whatever you want in the way of games, and we'll deal with food when we see how many are interested. I won't be there until 7:45, but John will be there at 7pm. The lodge officially closes at 11pm, so there will be a \"don't start new games after 10:30\" rule in effect. Hope to see everyone there!",

Over the next few months, we'll play games by modern masters Vital Lacerda, Uwe Rosenberg, Daniele Tascini, Alexander Pfister, as well as games by lesser known, but also great designers like Alexander Huemer. Plus, other fun stuff you want to play",
